# Known open

Items that are open and unowned: a decision nobody has taken, or a capability something shipped
already claims and does not have. They live here because the alternative is a working note that gets
deleted, and then the same investigation runs a second time.

What does **not** belong here. A refusal that stays refused is a decision - `RENDERER-RULES.md`'s
*Decisions that stay closed*, or `tooling/CLAUDE.md`'s. A measurement belongs in the commit that made
it, and in the `reason` recorded with the baseline it moved.

Delete an entry when it closes.

## Four held-pose style rows are measured constant, and their names say they should move

The style emitter measures frog `jump`, bat `rest` and both axolotl `play_dead` selections
(baby clip, adult factor) as constant over the whole period - every clip channel one distinct
keyframe value - so they ship as held poses (`sources: []`, a distinct but motionless render).
Their vanilla names say they animate. Either the vanilla clips genuinely hold a pose and the
selection's motion lives somewhere the walk does not carry, or the offline measurement (clip
constancy, the time-axis rule, or the extraction of those clips) is wrong. Investigate against
the client; if they should move, the fix is in the measurement or the keyframe walk, and the
rows re-emit with real sources.

## Whether an adult axolotl can play dead decides the (id, age) pair mechanism

The catalog allows two rows sharing one id with disjoint `age` members - coined solely for the
axolotl's `play_dead` (baby clip row vs adult factor row), with `appliesTo` disambiguating at
resolve. If vanilla adult axolotls never play dead, the adult factor row is a fiction: drop it,
and the per-(id, age) uniqueness relaxation collapses back to plain per-entity id uniqueness.
Check the vanilla behaviour before building anything else on the pair mechanism.
