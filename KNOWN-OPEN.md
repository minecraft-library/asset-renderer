# Known open

Items that are open and unowned: a decision nobody has taken, or a capability something shipped
already claims and does not have. They live here because the alternative is a working note that gets
deleted, and then the same investigation runs a second time.

What does **not** belong here. A refusal that stays refused is a decision - `RENDERER-RULES.md`'s
*Decisions that stay closed*, or `tooling/CLAUDE.md`'s. A measurement belongs in the commit that made
it, and in the `reason` recorded with the baseline it moved.

## PlayerOptions has no style knob, and coining one needs a catalog source for the player

The style axis is a string knob on `EntityOptions` resolved against the entity's shipped catalog.
The player renders through its own pipeline, holds no row in `entity_models.json`, and its sweeps
gauge look rather than bytes - so a style knob on `PlayerOptions` today would be a string with
nothing to resolve against. Deferred deliberately by the owner (2026-09-01), with the axis kept
collision-free: adding the knob later needs a player-side source of catalog rows.

`PoseStyle` names no bag at all - `AppearanceOptions.applies` asks the appearance rather than the
request carrying one - so the row type is answerable for a subject whose options are not an
entity's, and a player catalog shipping age-free rows never reaches it either way. What still spells
`EntityOptions` is `StyleSelection.resolve` and the `byId` overload behind it, which is where the
axis would have to grow a shape the player bag can answer.

**That shape is not an `AppearanceOptions` on `PlayerOptions`.** `AppearanceOptions` stays
entity-specific by decision, so the player does not gain one. What the three bags share is an
appearance concern nothing abstracts yet, and organising that is its own job, deliberately not
attached to this entry - a knob coined by widening the player bag to look like an entity's would be
settling that question by accident.
